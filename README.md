This project requires the knowledge of 

* Making API routes
* Allowing us to us CRUD operations for Products, Categories , and Tags
* Inter connecting our databases in SQL
* Seeding our databases
* Making SQL models in Javascript

Once the application is Forked or Cloned you open your terminal and run

1) npm i

2) mysql -u root -p

3) source db/schema.sql

4) node seeds/index.js

5) npm run start


## Challenges

Some challenges I ran into were realizing how important capitalization was on our models which broke my table or seeded
a portion of the database, entering our JSON data when updating or creating in Insomnia(more syntax related), and at the start 
knowing how to get our apis running since it had been a while since i touched back up on this
